            Hello World! OOPS, we mean, Hello, Matrix Master Community! We are Group #9. We have started our bootcamp in the 13 of June 2022. It was not Friday, but we have started on Friday. Ahah. 
            Sorry guys, we actually don't remember all your names, but it was cool meeting!

                Very motivated! But, unfortunately, not for everybody. We have started from 22 students. We worked very hard, very (just believe us). Especially first two weeks, before our First Challenge. And then one month till Second Challenge, and also two weeks till Third Challenge.

                On our way we have lost more then half of our teamâ€¦ And now there are 9 of us! We are working in our web application  - creating Matrix Master Community, where you can find a solution for your problems (and maybe answers to Challenges, who knows), or register and add your own question!
